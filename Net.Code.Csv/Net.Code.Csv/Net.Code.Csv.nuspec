    <description>My own CSV parser. The itch was a problem in a CSV I got that contained quotes inside quoted fields. That situation was not handled well by the LumenWorks.Framework.IO parser, and I didn't manage to fix it in the original code, so I refactored and eventually rewrote it completely...This CSV parser now handles that situation, apart from all the LumenWorks specs.</description>
